#Java-SQL-Workout

Back-end for React, Redux, Spring Boot, Java, SQL Workout List App

Deployed: https://workout-list-java.herokuapp.com/

This is an CRUD backend using Spring Boot, Java, and SQL.  This is in API that can be used by a number of front-end frameworks such as React and AngularJS.  You just have to make the correct API calls.  The request links are as follows:

Create: https://workout-list-java.herokuapp.com/api/steps
Read: https://workout-list-java.herokuapp.com/api/steps
Updated: https://workout-list-java.herokuapp.com/api/steps/:id
Delete: https://workout-list-java.herokuapp.com/api/steps/:id

The API can be expanded to be more robust but for now is an example of how to use Spring Boot, Java, and SQL to create your own API.  The API also limits who can access it, so for now, you can only view the code and use the UI/UX I have provided below.

The Front-end is deployed here: https://adrianb13.github.io/ReactRedux-Workout/

This was created to show how the API can be utilized as an everyday user application such as a Workout List Tracker. The front-end uses React and Redux.
